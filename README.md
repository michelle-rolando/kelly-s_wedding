# kelly-s_wedding

I created this website for my friend Kelly's wedding.
The main section idea was taken from this YouTube tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RFcD3ULkAbc&t=2068s
The next sections were adapted based on the couple's needs and ideas.
One of the most challenging parts was completing the project in a short time because the wedding was a couple of months away; however, 
I learned to make proper suggestions to the couple during the discussions, and set real deadlines.


Collaborators:
  -Cynthia Soto Caballero: https://github.com/cynthiasunrise
  -Renatto Pantoja: https://github.com/dev-renatto-pantoja
  -Abel Bou
  
Cynthia and Renatto are great friends and both are wise in terms of HTML, CSS, Javascript and many other programming languages.
Both helped me fix bugs in the Header, Main, and Couple sections. 
They also helped me with some CSS issues that I encountered while making the site as well as with the media queries.

My mentor from Crehana, Abel Bou, helped me center the table and use the proper extension for the images.
I struggled with the image source because I was working with Visual Studio Code and they appeared to be fine locally,
however; when I deployed the site, the images failed to appear. 

I am grateful for having done this project and feel like my knowledge of HTML and CSS has gotten "stronger than yesterday" after developing it.
I am also grateful with all those who contributed to its realization.
